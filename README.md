# FastButtons
Adds buttons for admins that allow them to instantly mute, warn, kick or ban a player or force him to spectators. If the infection plugin is installed, admins can also infect a player. The widgets position and buttons are configurable using the ManiaControl settings editor.
## Setup
### Requirements
No other plugins are required, just a ManiaPlanet server with <a href="http://maniacontrol.com">ManiaControl</a>. For infection support, the <a href="//github.com/mewin/MC-Infection">infection plugin</a> is needed.
FastButtons runs fine with ManiaControl v0.162 but should also work with any newer version.
### Installation
To install this you can use ManiaControls plugin manager or download the php file and drop it into "[ManiaControl]/plugins/mewin/". If the folder does not exist, create it.
## License
FastButtons is licensed under the GPLv3, see LICENSE for more information.
